Requirements
------------

- Kanboard >= 1.0.29
- PHP >= 5.3.3
- Beanstalkd daemon

Installation
------------

You have the choice between 3 methods:

1. Install the plugin from the Kanboard plugin manager in one click
2. Download the zip file and decompress everything under the directory `plugins/Beanstalk`
3. Clone this repository into the folder `plugins/Beanstalk`

Note: Plugin folder is case-sensitive.

Configuration
-------------

By default this plugin assume that beanstalkd is running on `localhost`.
To change the default values, define those parameters in your config file:

```php
define('QUEUE_NAME', 'kanboard');
define('BEANSTALKD_HOSTNAME', '127.0.0.1');
```

You also need to run the Kanboard's worker:

```bash
./cli worker
```

The worker must have the same permissions as the web application (same user).
You should run the worker with a process manager like [supervisord](http://supervisord.org) or similar.

Docker help
-----------

Using the official Docker distributed for Kanboard, you can implement this approach following these simple steps:

* Create a subfolder /etc/services.d/cli_worker and a text file /etc/services.d/cli_worker/run
* Create a subfolder /etc/services.d/beanstalk and a text file /etc/services.d/beanstalk/run

These "run" files are required for s6-svscan already included in the image to automatically load and supervise the two processes required

* For cli_worker/run define contents:
```
#!/bin/execlineb -P
/usr/bin/beanstalkd
```

* For beanstalk/run define contents:
```
#!/bin/execlineb -P
/var/www/app/cli worker
```

Restart the docker and you should be all set.
